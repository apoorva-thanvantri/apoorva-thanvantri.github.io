I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Caltech. Currently, I am a member of the [Rigorous Systems Research Group](https://rsrg.cms.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, working with Professor Adam Wierman. Previously, I conducted research at [Caltech's Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.caltech.edu/).

This fall, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services on the Outposts Team. I previously interned as a Quantitative Research Intern at JP Morgan. 

My primary research goal is to develop reliable machine learning models in applications where safety guarantees are critical, such as power systems and robotics.

Currently, I am a member of [Georgia Gkioxari's](https://gkioxari.github.io/) lab at Caltech. Previously, I worked with [Dr. Oscar Leong](https://www.oscarleong.com) in [Katie Bouman's Computational Cameras](https://computationalcameras.org) lab.

Last summer, I was a Machine Learning Intern at Apple on the Media Analysis team. I have also interned at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

My interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, neurosymbolic AI, and multimodal learning. My primary research goal is to determine how to best add structure to visual priors to improve embodied intelligence and reasoning. -->
